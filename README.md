# folio
My personal portfolio made using Nuxt. This serves as a central hub for all my development and design work.

## Deployment
Run the following commands in sequence `yarn build` -> `yarn generate` -> `yarn deploy`

This will deploy the app to the github page (davidwallacesadler.github.io/folio)
